##  Overview

This project focuses on the creation of a **detailed residential house plan** using industry-standard CAD software. The design includes all major architectural components such as rooms, doors, windows, dimensions, furniture layout, and ventilation details. The goal is to provide a functional, comfortable, and modern living space that caters to the basic requirements of a small to medium-sized family.

The DWG file contains a well-layered 2D drawing that conforms to drafting standards typically required in municipal approvals, client presentations, and structural engineering projects. The plan is modular, scalable, and ready for future development such as structural detailing or 3D visualization in Revit or SketchUp.

##  Project Objectives

- To design a well-balanced and space-efficient house plan for residential use.
- To apply CAD drafting principles to create an accurate and scalable blueprint.
- To include practical zoning (private, public, service areas).
- To maintain balance between structural efficiency and aesthetics.
- To create documentation that can be used in professional portfolios.

##  Features of the House Plan

###  Residential Zones

- **Bedrooms:** 2 or 3 bedrooms (depending on configuration), placed for privacy and natural light.
- **Living Room:** Centrally located for access and interaction.
- **Dining Area:** Integrated with the living/kitchen zone.
- **Bathrooms:** Common and attached bathrooms placed near bedrooms and public areas.
- **Kitchen:** With modular layout and adjacent utility space.
- **Balconies/Verandas:** Optional open spaces for outdoor ventilation and light.
- **Store Room / Study Room:** Extra enclosed space for utility or personal work.

###  Circulation & Ventilation

- Well-defined corridors for movement between rooms.
- Use of windows and open areas to maintain air cross-flow.
- Logical door and window placement for maximum space usage.

###  Orientation

- North-facing layout with natural light flow optimization.
- Bedrooms are placed away from harsh afternoon sun (west side).
- Kitchen oriented for daylight and ventilation.
